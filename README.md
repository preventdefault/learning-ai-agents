# Learning about AI Agents by Building One from Scratch

AI agents often still feel like magic to me. They act on their own, complete tasks independently, and are becoming more and more reliable. With every passing week, their capabilities appear to grow without limit.

But what is an agent, actually? What components and principles make an LLM into an agent? How does it work conceptually?

I have so many questions about AI agents that I decided the best way to learn more about this technology is to build an agent from scratch.

This is where the journey starts.

## Introduction

### What makes an AI system an agent?

This is often the first question: What is an agent, actually?

In a nutshell, an AI agent is a system designed to perceive its environment and take actions to achieve a specific goal. It's an extension of a large language model (LLM), enhanced with the abilities to plan, use tools, and interact with its surroundings.

Or, even simpler: an AI agent is like a smart helper that understands its surroundings and takes actions to reach a goal.

This project runs entirely locally, without any special tooling, frameworks, or APIs. Just plain JavaScript.

## Setup

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- Install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)

## LLM

The LLM used is a Qwen SLM (Small Language Model) available in LM Studio: [Qwen3-4B-Thinking 2507](https://lmstudio.ai/models/qwen/qwen3-4b-thinking-2507)

This model has reasoning capabilities and is trained for tool use.
It's small (around 2 GB), so it should run on most modern consumer hardware.
